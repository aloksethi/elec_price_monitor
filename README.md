Python side of the project. The overall idea is to grab the electricity pricing from entsoe.eu, parse it, create a gui out of it, make an image and send the image data to the uC which will then display it on the epaper display.
Why the whole project is not in C and running on the uC, just cause i want to get my hands dirty with python. also, not very comfy setting a uC facing the web, knowing that no way i am going to be doing any maintenance of the uC code.
